# NYC-Central-Park-squirrel-count

And on a more fun note...

Based on the Central Park Squirrel Census 2019 Report (which is a real thing) in .csv, main.py generates "squirrels_count.csv" with a separate count for each fur color: gray, cinnamon (that's a red) and black.

Tech used:
- Python
- pandas
